% usage: [B,A] = invfreqz(H,F,nB,nA)

% Fit filter B(z)/A(z)to the complex frequency response H at frequency
% points F.  A and B are real polynomial coefficients of order nA and nB.
% Optionally, the fit-errors can be weighted vs frequency according to
% the weights W.
% Note: all the guts are in invfreq.m
%
% H: desired complex frequency response
% F: normalized frequncy (0 to pi) (must be same length as H)
% nA: order of the denominator polynomial A
% nB: order of the numerator polynomial B
% W: vector of weights (must be same length as F)
%
% Example:
%     [B,A] = butter(4,1/4);
%     [H,F] = freqz(B,A);
%     [Bh,Ah] = invfreq(H,F,4,4);
%     Hh = freqz(Bh,Ah);
%     disp(sprintf('||frequency response error|| = %f',norm(H-Hh)));
