%# Usage:
%# 
%# xt = sampled2continuous( xn , T, t )
%# 
%# Calculate the x(t) reconstructed
%# from samples x[n] sampled at a rate 1/T samples
%# per unit time.
%# 
%# t is all the instants of time when you need x(t) 
%# from x[n]; this time is relative to x[0] and not
%# an absolute time.
%# 
%# This function can be used to calculate sampling rate
%# effects on aliasing, actual signal reconstruction
%# from discrete samples.
