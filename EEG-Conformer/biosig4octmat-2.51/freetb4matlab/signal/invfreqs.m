% Usage: [B,A] = invfreqs(H,F,nB,nA)
%        [B,A] = invfreqs(H,F,nB,nA,W)
%        [B,A] = invfreqs(H,F,nB,nA,W,iter,tol,'trace')
%
% Fit filter B(s)/A(s)to the complex frequency response H at frequency
% points F.  A and B are real polynomial coefficients of order nA and nB.
% Optionally, the fit-errors can be weighted vs frequency according to
% the weights W.
% Note: all the guts are in invfreq.m
%
% H: desired complex frequency response
% F: frequency (must be same length as H)
% nA: order of the denominator polynomial A
% nB: order of the numerator polynomial B
% W: vector of weights (must be same length as F)
%
% Example:
%       B = [1/2 1];
%       A = [1 1];
%       w = linspace(0,4,128);
%       H = freqs(B,A,w);
%       [Bh,Ah] = invfreqs(H,w,1,1);
%       Hh = freqs(Bh,Ah,w);
%       plot(w,[abs(H);abs(Hh)])
%       legend('Original','Measured');
%       err = norm(H-Hh);
%       disp(sprintf('L2 norm of frequency response error = %f',err));
