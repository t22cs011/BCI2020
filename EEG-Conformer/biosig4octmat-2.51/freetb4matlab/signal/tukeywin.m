%# @deftypefn {Function File} {@var{w} =} tukeywin (@var{m}, @var{r})
%# Return the filter coefficients of a Tukey window (also known as the
%# cosine-tapered window) of length @var{m}. @var{r} defines the ratio
%# between the constant section and and the cosine section. It has to be
%# between 0 and 1. The function returns a Hanning window for @var{r}
%# egals 0 and a full box for @var{r} egals 1. By default @var{r} is set
%# to 1/2.
%#
%# For a definition of the Tukey window, see e.g. Fredric J. Harris,
%# 'On the Use of Windows for Harmonic Analysis with the Discrete Fourier
%# Transform, Proceedings of the IEEE', Vol. 66, No. 1, January 1978,
%# Page 67, Equation 38.
