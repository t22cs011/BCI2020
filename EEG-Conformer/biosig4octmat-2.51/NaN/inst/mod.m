function [z,e] = mod(x,y)
% MOD(x,y) calculates Modules Y from X 
%
%     z = x - y * floor(x/y);
%     e = eps * floor(x/y);
%
%    [z,e] = MOD(X,Y)
%	z is the modulus of Y for X
%	e is the error tolerance, for checking the accuracy
%		z(e > abs(y)) is not defined 
%
% 	z has always the same sign than y
