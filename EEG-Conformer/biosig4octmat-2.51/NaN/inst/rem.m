function [z,e] = rem(x,y)
% REM calculates remainder of X / Y  
%
%     z = x - y * fix(x/y);
%     e = eps * fix(x/y);
%
%    [z,e] = REM(X,Y)
%	z is the remainder of X / Y
%	e is the error tolerance, for checking the accuracy
%		z(e > abs(y)) is not defined 
%
% 	z has always the same sign than x
